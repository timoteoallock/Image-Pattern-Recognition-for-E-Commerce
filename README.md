# Image-Pattern-Recognition-for-E-Commerce

This repository contains a multimodal text and vision model to recognize patterns and tags in clothing items from images present on e-commerce platforms. 
The goal is to ultimately integrate this model in the upload phase of a product so that metadata such as clothing patter can be automatically inserted without manual intervention.
